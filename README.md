The V-encryption algorithm is an encryption algorithm that can't be broken, best for security purpose. You can see the layout of this project by looking at the image of how the encryption algorithm works. You can download the V-Encryption Algorithm.py and run it, it will show you a GUI in where you have to enter in text, and it will then show you the original text and the encrypted text.
